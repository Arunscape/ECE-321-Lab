\section{Stakeholders to consider}
\label{stakeholders}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Customers
 \item End users
 \item Requirement alalysts
 \item Developers
 \item Testers
 \item Documentation writers
 \item Project managers
 \item Legal staff
 \item Manufacturers
\end{enumerate}

\section{Things we need:}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item description of functionality
 \item agreement on problem definition
 \item root causes - why do we need the system?
 \item who are the Stakeholders?  \ref{stakeholders}
 \item system boundary
 \item constraints
 \item keep in mind: needs vs features
\end{enumerate}

\section{Types of questions to ask:}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item why is this
 \item what else could
 \item what happens when
 \item why do you
 \item why don't you
 \item does anyone ever
 \item context-free questions
\end{enumerate}

\section{structure of the interview:}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Establish the customer or user profile
 \item assess the problem
 \item understand the user enviroment
 \item recap at the end
 \item assess your solution
 \item assess the opportunity
 \item assess the reliability, performance, and support needs
 \item other Requirements
 \item wrap-up
 \item recap
\end{enumerate}



\section{List of questions to ask:}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item establishing the user profile:\\
       what are your key responsibilities\\
       what outputs do you produce or whom?\\
       when is the solution successful for you?\\
       what problems interfere with your success?\\
       what makes your job easier or more difficult?\\
       who are the users and what are their backgrounds?\\
       what platforms are in use now, and in the future?\\
       are there additional relevant applications?\\
       what are your expectations for training time?\\
       what kind of user help do you need? (manual, user support)
       
       
 \item Here's what we think the problem definition is:
       -------------------------------------------------------
       it will affect: ---------------------------------------
       which will result in ----------------------------------
       so the solution should have these features:------------
       which has these benefits: -----------------------------
       Do you have anything to add?
 \item What's the highest priority issue/root cause? \\
       for each problem: \\
       why does this problem exist?\\
       how do you solve it now?\\
       how would you rather solve it in the future?\\
       --- rank the other root causes ---
 \item -- stakeholders --
 \item Who are the users?\\
       Who is the customer/buyer of the system?\\
       Who will evaluate and who will maintain the system\\
       Anyone else?
 \item --system boundary --\\
       Who will operate it?\\
       who will supply, use, or remove information from the system\\
       where will the system be used?\\
       what other external systems will interact with this one?\\
 \item -- constraints --
       technical constrains\\
       economical\\
       political - any laws we should be aware of?\\
       system-imposed constraints -- compatible with existing systems? operating systems\\
       enviromental constraints\\
       security\\
 \item what resources are available?
\end{enumerate}
